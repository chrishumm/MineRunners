# MineRunner

MineRunner is an open-source game written in C++. It uses the allegro graphics library for drawing sprites onto the screen. The objective of the game is to get to the end of the stage with as many gold points as possible whilst avoiding enemies. 

It is currently in an alpha state and is actively being developed as you read this! If you want to help or contribute, see [below](#support)

# Features

- An auto-save game system
- Parallax scrolling with sprites.
- Pixel-perfect collision. 
- Levels generated from files on the fly.
- Multiple enemies with different behaviours

# TODO

As an alpha game, the following features are being worked on and implemented:
- Weapon system
- Bosses
- Level editor
- Better AI


# Getting Started

You can download the installer from the release section. It currently works on Windows, though you can compile and run on Linux.

## Installing from source (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:

- A C++ compiler (Either Visual Studio or Code::Blocks for Windows)
- [Allegro 5.0 and above](https://liballeg.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

If using Visual Studio, you can use nuget to simplfy integrating allegro, otherwise manually point to the includes and lib folders in your solution. If using Linux, ensure allegro I suggest following [this guide](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki/Quickstart)
# Alpha Version

Currently, Minerunner is an alpha project and used as a proof-of-concept. I have implemented the bare bones and intent to add to it at a later future date.
